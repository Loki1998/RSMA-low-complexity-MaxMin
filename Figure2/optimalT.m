% Fig. 2 of the above paper will be reproduced by running this MATLAB 
% script. By changing the variable 'SNRdB', you can reproduce Fig. 2(a-c).
%
% This script relies on function 'lowComplexity.m' and 'maxMinRate.m'.
% Don't forget to put 'lowComplexity.m' and 'maxMinRate.m' in the same folder.
